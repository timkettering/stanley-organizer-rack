## 3D Printed Funnel + Spacer

Functionally, the funnel+spacer is not required.  But if you are able to print them out, then you can save yourself a lot of tedious measuring and just
screw the spacers to the sides of the rack walls and then place the rails inside.  The spacers also have a filleted edge to help guide the organizer bin when inserting them in the rack.
